## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **🔧 Fixing Old Extension Icons**
If you're still seeing old icons in the Chrome extension, we've created modern, professional icons for the QA Toolkit:

1. Open the [icons/fix-icons.html](file:///c:/Users/Mehdi/Desktop/Download/Nouveau%20dossier/icons/fix-icons.html) file in your browser
2. Click the "Fix Icons" button to regenerate all PNG icons from the new SVG sources
3. Save the downloaded PNG files and replace the existing ones in the icons directory
4. Reload the Chrome extension to see the updated, modern icons

The new icons feature:
- A professional purple background representing quality assurance
- A white checkmark symbolizing successful testing
- A yellow star/circle representing attention to detail
- "QA" text for clear identification
- Consistent design across all sizes (16px, 48px, and 128px)

### **🎨 Icon Design Details**
The new icons use a modern, professional design with:
- Purple color scheme (#4F46E5) representing technology and quality
- Clean, rounded corners for a contemporary look
- Clear visual elements that represent QA/testing
- Responsive design that looks good at all sizes
- SVG source files for infinite scalability
